            <h2>Rules</h2> 
            <p>In the Kitty Jungle, the player encounters new feral cats, and befriends them with careful pets. </p>
            <p>Click the "pet" button to pet the cat.</p>
            <p>At any time, you can click the arrow button to move on to the next level.</p>
            <p>To win the level and get a special badge, you must pet the cat enough times to befriend it. When you have made a new cat friend, you will be prompted to go to the next level to meet more cats.</p>
            <p>But be careful...if you choose not to move on to the next level, and keep petting your cat friend, they might not like it...</p>
            <p>You lose the game if a cat attacks you!</p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Kitty Jungle is a real place!</p>
            <p>Inspired by the backyard of my Bed-Stuy apartment in the summer of 2015, when I used to spend whole afternoons watching the feral colony below.</p> 
            <p>Because my backyard was wildly overgrown with weeds, my friends and I dubbed it "kitty jungle," and narrated daily episodes of drama and kitten-y cuteness.</p>
